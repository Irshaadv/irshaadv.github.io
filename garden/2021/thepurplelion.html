<p>"Akhi if you love Allah please buy Arsenal." </p>
<p><a rel="noopener" class="external-link" href="https://twitter.com/Abdullahi_wolf/status/1430311164127416322" target="_blank">This tweet</a> is modern poetry. This was Etsu Yahya, ostensible an Arsenal fan, replying to a tweet by a Qatari royal, owner (or president or some such) of Al-Arabi football club in Qatar. Cryptic as the tweet was, it <a rel="noopener" class="external-link" href="https://www.dohanews.co/qatari-royals-tweet-sparks-speculation-over-arsenal-takeover/" target="_blank">ignited speculation</a> that the London club is for sale. </p>
<p>Which, to no surprise, in turn rekindled the debate about money in football. The debate is a hotly contested one, and there are no shortage of opinions. To this noise, I will now add my own opinion. </p>
<p>Or at least a somewhat tangentially related one. </p>
<p>For a while now, I've been passively thinking about the <a data-href="English Premier League" href="C:\Users\irsha\Dropbox\3 Common\10 Notes\Obs\2 Home\5 IV Personal\5 IV Projects\7 Year 2021\4 Daily Notes\2021-08-27\English%20Premier%20League.html" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">English Premier League</a>'s purple Lion. You know the one. The strong, stern lion with the purple face and purple crown that greets you when you open the app. And when you watch a clip. And when you watch a game. And when you see a football meme. Basically anytime you interact with the English Premier League, the Purple Lion is there. </p>
<p>The face of dominance. The King</p>

<h2 data-heading="Lions and Imperialism">Lions and Imperialism</h2>
<p>I'm <a rel="noopener" class="external-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/5qrnb0/why_is_englands_national_animal_the_lion_even/" target="_blank">not the first</a> to wonder about the English obsession with lions, given that lions are not exactly native to that part of the world. A brief Google is not sufficient to untangle the origins of how the British came to embrace the "Lion" as a key symbol (Some point to Richard the Lionheart, others to one of the Edwards), but I can't shake the feeling that this is linked to the British colonial project in some way. </p>
<p>It reminds me of the ideas of <a data-href="Edward Said" href="C:\Users\irsha\Dropbox\3 Common\10 Notes\Obs\2 Home\5 IV Personal\5 IV Projects\7 Year 2021\4 Daily Notes\2021-08-27\Edward%20Said.html" class="internal-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Edward Said</a>, which he captured in his book on Culture and Imperialism, which I happened to pick up a few days ago during a period of no electricity and no internet (and a minor flu). I still only understand 10% of what Said was writing about, but one of the ideas that has always stuck with me is how the novel, as a cultural artifact, played an essential role in the expansion of the British imperial project. </p>
<p>At the risk of being shouted at, I think that the novel has waned a bit in relation to it's cultural impact, since the heyday of imperialism. Perhaps still dominant, it faces the onslaught of the likes of TikTok videos among all the other "new media" formats. </p>
<p>And so while the English (or British - I can never use the correct one in the correct context) Imperial project is long dead (at least formally), there is some curious relationship here between the Purple Lion that greets you when you open your EPL app to be yet again hurt by Arsenal FC. </p>
<p>The English Premier League is, in my view, a dominant cultural force. Surprisingly (to me), it's not the highest earning sports league in the world (that honour apparently falls to American Football, another thing the Americans seem to have taken from the English), but my gut feeling tells me that it has the largest geographic dispersion in terms of following (research needed). Many parts of Africa and Asia seem to be huge fans of the league, for example. </p>
<p>I can't quiet put my finger on it yet- the words elude me, but there seems to be a centuries long story arc that connects the purple lion to Richard the Lionheart, the East India Company (and British Imperialism more generally), and the talk on supper tables in 2021 across the world about how Arsenal has fallen from grace. </p>
